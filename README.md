# tibiantis-contact-list
 Manage your contacts from the Tibiantis server.

The project was created as part of learning how to develop web applications. I used tools such as: Express JS, jsdom and uuid. Player contacts are stored in cookies. I do not guarantee that the application is free of bugs or security vulnerabilities.


Best regards,
